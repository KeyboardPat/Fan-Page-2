            <p>Born on the 21st of November 1965, Björk was raised in Reykjavík, Iceland. She was first introduced to music when she enrolled at Barnamúsíkskóli, where she studied classical piano and flute.</p>

                <p>After singing Tina Charles's 1976 hit "I Love to Love", at a school recital, Björk’s teachers sent a recording of her performance to the RÚV radio station, which was then Iceland's only radio station.
                The recordingws was broadcast across Iceland, and led to a representative of the Fálkinn record label offering Björk a recording contract after hearing it. Her eponymous début album, Björk, was recorded when she was just 11 years old, and was released in Iceland in December 1977.</p>

                <h2>The Björk Bands, Part 1</h2>
                <p>Inspired by punk rock music, which was growing in popularity across Iceland, Björk formed the all-girl punk band Spit and Snot during her teens.
                1980 was a very productive year for Björk. Not only did she form a jazz fusion group, Exodus, she also collaborated with another group, JAM80, and graduated from music school.</p>

                 <td><section id="RiseToFameSection"><h2>The Björk Bands, Part 2</h2>
                        <p>In 1982, Björk went on to form another group, Tappi Tíkarrass, with bassist Jakob Magnússon. The group released their debut EP Bitið fast í vitið ("Bite Hard Into Hell" in Icelandic), in August 1982, before dropping their debut album Miranda in December 1983. The group went on to star in the documentary Rokk í Reykjavík, Björk being featured on the cover of the VHS release. It was around this time that Björk met guitarist Þór Eldon and surrealist group Medusa, which also included poet Sjón, with whom she started a lifelong collaboration and formed another group, Rokka Rokka Drum. For Björk, her time as part of Medusa was "a gorgeous D.I.Y. organic university”, teeming with “extreme fertility!" that allowed their creativity to flourish. Björk also featured artist on the track "Afi" by Björgvin Gíslason which appeared on his 1983 record Örugglega.<p>
                            <p>With their radio show Áfangar about to be discontinued, two radio personalities, Ásmundur Jónsson and Guðni Rúnar, put out a request for musicians to play on one last live radio show. Björk would then team up with Einar Melax (from the group Fan Houtens Kókó), Einar Örn Benediktsson (from Purrkur Pillnikk), Guðlaugur Kristinn Óttarsson and Sigtryggur Baldursson (from Þeyr), and Birgir Mogensen (from Spilafífl) to form a new act for the concert, the gothic rock group Gott kvöld. It was during her time in this group that Björk began to develop her distinctive vocal style, embracing the cathartic quality of howls and shrieks. When the group decided to continue playing together, they adopted the name Kukl ("Sorcery" in Icelandic). Björk's acquaintance gave the group their studio to record in, which allowed Kukl to release their first single in 1983. The group’s breakout performance was at a festival in Iceland being headlined by English anarchist punk band Crass, whose record label, Crass Records offered Kukl a record deal. After the release of Kukl’s second and final album, Holidays in Europe (The Naughty Nought) in 1986, the band split up due to personal conflict. However, Björk continued to collaborate with Guðlaugur, forming a group named the Elgar Sisters. Some of the songs they recorded would go in to be included in Björk solo singles as B-sides.<p>
            
            <h3>Björk the Actress</h3>
            <p>Björk’s acting debut was playing the character of Margit, a girl whose mother has been killed for practising witchcraft, in the film ‘The Juniper Tree’ (filmed in 1986, released in 1990), directed by Nietzchka Keene. The film is a tale of witchcraft based on the Brothers Grimm story.</p>

            <h4>Björk's Biggest Band: The Sugarcubes</h4>
            <p>Former band members Einar Örn and Eldon would go on to form the arts collective Smekkleysa ("Bad Taste" in Icelandic), which was intended to be a record label and book publishing company. Björk, alongside ex-Kukl members Melax and Sigtryggur, as well as Bragi Ólafsson and Friðrik Erlingson from Purrkur Pillnikk, joined the collective before forming a band to make more money. They wanted to be known as Þukl, but wound up being advertised as Kukl (Björk's previous band). At a later concert supporting Icelandic band Stuðmenn, the band unveiled their new name Sykurmolarnir ("Sugarcubes" in Icelandic). Their first double A-side single, "Einn mol'á mann", featuring the songs "Ammæli" ("Birthday") and "Köttur" ("Cat"), was released on 21st November 1986, Björk's 21st birthday.</p>
            
            <p>At the end of that year, the Sugarcubes joined the record label One Little Indian. Their first English single, "Birthday", was released in the United Kingdom on 17 August 1987; a week later, Melody Maker declared the song single of the week by. The Sugarcubes would then sign a distribution deal with US-based Elektra Records and record their debut album, Life's Too Good, before releasing it in 1988. After the release of the album and the birth of Eldon and Björk’s child, the couple would get a divorce despite being in the same group. Life’s Too Good went on to sell more than one million copies worldwide.</p>
            
            <p>Björk contributed background vocals to the 1987 album Loftmynd by Megas, and would go on to provide more background vocals on his subsequent album Höfuðlausnir (1988) and Hættuleg hljómsveit & glæpakvendið Stella (1990).</p>
            
            <p>In the final quarter of 1988, the Sugarcubes’ North American tour was received positively. The band also had a Saturday Night Live appearance on the 15th of October. At the end of the year Björk contributed a solo performance of the Christmas song "Jólakötturinn" ("The Christmas Cat") to the compilation Hvít Er Borg Og Bær.</p>

            <h5>The beginning of Björk the solo artist, the end of the Sugarcubes</h5>
            <p>After the release of their second record Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week! (1989) to poor reception and a lengthy international tour, the Sugarcubes would go on a hiatus. This gave Björk an opportunity to begin working on her solo projects, and partake in a greater number of collaborations. In 1990 she sang backing vocals on Gums by Bless before recording Gling-Gló, a collection of popular jazz and original work, performed with the jazz group Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar. Until 2011 this was her best-selling album in her home country. Björk also contributed vocals to 808 State's album ex:el, an experience which piqued her interest in house music. She contributed vocals on the songs "Qmart" and on "Ooops", which was released as a single in the UK in 1991. She also sang on "Falling", on the album Island by Current 93 and Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson. In the same year she met harpist Corky Hale, partaking in a recording session where they created a track that would eventually be featured on her future debut solo album, aptly named Debut.</p>
